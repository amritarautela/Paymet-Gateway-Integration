        <p>None of a child may be left alone with a war trauma. This is our mission. With your help, we give psychological and psychosocial support to children who suffered as a result of war operations.
            
            It helps them to win the consequences of the war and develop themselves.
            
            We also help families to cope with everyday difficulties, treatment and rehabilitation of children, giving an individual support.
            
            To give children a voice we create a video content, and we are also engaged in promoting children rights in order to change the children’s rights protection system in the country.
            
            Our objective is that every child who has suffered from the war in Ukraine must get psychological help in time.
            
            Our values: respect to child’s dignity and rights; understanding of the needs of every child to be heard; faith in getting the best results only with the help of partnership and mutual aid.
            
            We are working in various villages and towns along the frontline in Donetsk and Luhansk regions.</p>
